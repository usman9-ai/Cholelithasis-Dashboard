![Project Image](./thumbnail.webp)

## Overview
A machine learning-based dashboard for predicting health status in **cholelithiasis (gallstone disease) patients**. This project includes data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation using various classification algorithms to assess patient risk and health outcomes.

## Features
- **Data Analysis**: Explore and preprocess cholelithiasis-related datasets.
- **Model Training**: Train various machine learning models to predict health statuses.
- **Evaluation**: Assess model performance using appropriate metrics.
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Visualize predictions and insights for better medical decision-making.
